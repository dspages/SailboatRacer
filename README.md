# Sailboat Racer

## Background
Sailboat Racer is a 3-d sailboat racing game with a detailed physics engine simulating the interactions of wind and water with the player's boat.

The player must successfully navigate the sea and reach flags, while avoiding obstacles. They will control the sails and the rudder of the boat.

## Functionality and MVP
Sailboat racer will support the following features

-A hand-rolled physics engine that calculates vectors and angles of incidence to produce realistic drag forces on the boat.

-Interactivity that allows the player to control the sails and rudder of the boat

-Goals and a timer to measure how quickly the player succeeded

-Multiple areas of increasing difficulty

In addition, the following bonus goals are possible

-Obstacles and hazards to avoid

-Detailed visual representation of forces acting on sails and ship

-Customize your sailboat to change its parameters

## Wireframes
The app will be a single page app consisting of a game view, buttons to pause, mute and reset the game, and links to the authors' githubs and linkedins.

## Technologies and technical challenges
The app will be built in JavaScript and use a 3d imaging library, preferably three.js. A lot of trigonometry will be involved in the backend and we may use a trig helper library or simply handroll the math.

The app will consist of a main HTML page, a style sheet, and separate javascript files to handle physics utility, display rendering, UI interfacing, and overall game logic.

The primary technical challenges will be

-Correctly rendering 3d objects using a novel library

-Optimizing the run time of the physics engine to enable smooth vector modification to create an experience that feels authentic to the user

## Things we accomplished this weekend
-Researched technologies and technical possibilities

-Got started on the alternative plan of a synchronized audio app. We set up GPS pings that could synchronize two phones but did not set up audio playback.
